I had a student (Jack Fogliasso) bring me a problem from a Microbiology lab where they are trying to identify bacteria using lasers. One of the items they wanted to understand was the absorption rates of different wavelenghts. So they have a machine to do the lasering and it reads out a text file that of coures has a ton of meta data in it, is semi-colon delimited, and there's one file per trial. So not the standard situation that one might encounter in a basic applied statistics class. 

Jack and I talked about automation and reproducibility and how R is great for tasks like this, and he got to work. What is shown below is an effective use of `dplyr` and to read in a data set from disk, do some processing, and create a visualization. This process can be expanded to any number of files thanks to the efficient looping of `foreach`, and the combiantion of `dplyr` and `ggplot2` can accomodate different file names, such as for different new bacteria.

# System setup
This example uses the `ggplot2`, `dplyr` and `foreach` packages. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(foreach)
```

# Data import

Read in the data for the three experimental trials.

1. get all .txt files in the working directory and put into a list. 
```{r}
list_files <- list.files(path="../../static/data/Jack", pattern = ".txt", full.names = TRUE) 
list_files
```

2. Use the `%do%` function in the `foreach` package to efficiently loop over all items in the list. 
This read in the data using `read.delim`, turns it into a data frame, so that we can add the file name to the data set before combining each data set using `rbind` (stacking or concatonating). 
```{r}
eColi <- foreach(i=1:length(list_files), .combine=rbind) %do% {
            read.delim(list_files[[i]], skip=66, sep=";") %>%
            data.frame() %>%
            mutate(file=gsub(".txt", "", list_files[[i]]))# add an identifier to index each trial
}
head(eColi)
```

3. Shorten the names to something reasonable. 
```{r}
names(eColi)[c(5:16,19:21)] <- paste0(rep(c("raw", "dark", "X", "abs", "irr"),3), 1:3)
names(eColi)
```

# Data Processing

Create the average absorbance of the 3 trials per wave length.
```{r}
eColi_abs <- eColi %>% group_by(Wavelength) %>% summarise(avgRelAbs = mean(abs1))
head(eColi_abs)
```

# Analyzing 

Plot the average relative absorbance for the E. coli. 
```{r}
ggplot(eColi_abs, aes(x=Wavelength, y=avgRelAbs)) + 
              geom_point(color="#CC0000") + geom_smooth(color="black") + 
              labs(title="Average Relative Absorbance of E. Coli", 
                   x="Wavelength (nm)", y="Absorbance")
```
