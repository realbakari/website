# Course Description
This course is designed as a primer to get the complete novice up and running with the basic knowledge of how to use the statistical programming language R in an environment that emphasizes reproducible research and literate programming. The target audience is anyone who wants to do their own data analysis. The course will cumulate with an peer-evaluated exploratory data analysis on either a pre-specified data set or your data set of choice. 


## Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students will be able to

* Import external data into R.
* Calculate summary statistics.
* Create informative data visualizations and tables.
* Perform data management techniques such as subsetting, aggregating data, and creating new variables. 
* Create a reproducible research document.
* Conduct an exploratory data analysis in a reproducible manner.

## Required Materials

* A reliable laptop that you can install programs onto. Contact me for alternatives.
    - Mac / Windows are easy. Linux/Unix installs are more difficult, but not impossible. 
* Reliable internet connection while on and off campus.
* A free [Data Camp](www.datacamp.com) account.
* Join the [Chico R Users Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/chico-rug) - This is our discussion forum to ask (and answer) questions outside of class. 
    - There is also a [Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/Chico-R-Users-Group/) - optional but useful if you want to stay connected to the community and learn about upcoming events. 
* Free programming software. Instructions and links to download, install and setup these programs can be found at http://www.norcalbiostat.com/Software/software_overview.html#/ <p class="text-danger"> (Update this link)</p>
    - [R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
    - [R Studio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
    - [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/): optional but very nice for producing professional quality PDF reports. 
        - Windows: Get the proTex distribution
        - Mac: You only have one choice.

## Schedule of Topics
The general outline of topics is listed below. A detailed most up to date schedule can be found on the course website. 

* Intro to the R language and it's packages
* R Studio suite of awesomeness
* Reproducible Research with R Markdown
* Importing data into R
* Functions
* Data Visualization
* Data Manipulation and Aggregation
* Functions for Statistical Analysis
* Exploratory Data Analysis


Attendance after week 5 is optional. This room is reserved for the entire semester at this day/time and may be used for short talks and additional workshops on various R topics. Primarily this time will be devoted to drop in R help time for the entire campus. 
You are welcome and encouraged to come and use this time and resources to develop and practice your ability to analyze data with R. 



## Adding and Dropping the course
The course is open enrollment. You may add at any time. All materials are posted on the course website. 
It would be very difficult to get caught up if you miss more than the first day, however you can work in the class at your own pace, you just won't be able to participate in the project peer evaluation.
