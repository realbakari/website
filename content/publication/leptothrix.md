abstract = "This paper outlines an innovative software development that utilises Quality of Service (QoS) and parallel technologies in Cisco Catalyst Switches to increase the analytical performance of a Network Intrusion Detection and Protection System (NIDPS) when deployed in high-speed networks. We have designed a real network to present experiments that use a Snort NIDPS. Our experiments demonstrate the weaknesses of NIDPSs, such as inability to process multiple packets and propensity to drop packets in heavy traffic and high-speed networks without analysing them. We tested Snort's analysis performance, gauging the number of packets sent, analysed, dropped, filtered, injected, and outstanding. We suggest using QoS configuration technologies in a Cisco Catalyst 3560 Series Switch and parallel Snorts to improve NIDPS performance and to reduce the number of dropped packets. Our results show that our novel configuration improves performance."
